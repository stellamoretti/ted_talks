# ted_talks

In this project I:
- Extract key topics from 2,500 TED talk transcripts using natural language processing techniques.
- Deconstructed the underlying structure of popular TED talks by conducting time-based sentiment analyses.
- Model the semantic trajectory of selected words over time by creating vector representations of TED speakers' vocabulary using
Gensim word2vec.
