What makes TED Talks so good? What do they all have in common?

To answer this question I used unsupervised machine learning methods on 2500 TED Talks dating between 2006 and 2017.

Specific tasks included:
• Extracting the key topics using NLP techniques
• Modeling the semantic trajectory of selected words over time by creating vector representations of TED speakers' vocabulary using Gensim word2vec, and
• Deconstructing the underlying structure of popular TED Talks by conducting time-based sentiment analyses.
